Reflecting the contacts in your phone to the application

  - Flutter

Note : If you do not request user permission or have it granted, the application will fail. For testing purposes, you can manually set the permissions for your test app in Settings for your app on the device that you are using. For Android, go to "Settings" - "Apps" - select your test app - "Permissions" - then turn "on" the slider for contacts.
